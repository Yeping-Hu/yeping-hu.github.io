I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Research Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. degree at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was a member of the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu){:target="_blank"} and I was advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/){:target="_blank"}. 

Working on multiple **AI for science** projects (e.g. physics, healthcare, biology) where machine learning techniques are leveraged to advance scientific research and discovery. I have served as PI and Co-PI in several Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) funded by the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). These collaborations involve working with energy-intensive industries with the aim of minimizing energy consumption. 

Our team is actively seeking research collaborations. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested.
