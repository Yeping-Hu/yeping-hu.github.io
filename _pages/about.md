I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. I am currently a member of the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu) and I am advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/). 

My research interests include **behavior prediction**, **decision making** and **motion planning** for intelligent agents such as autonomous vehicles and robots. Approaches that based on artificial neural networks, probabilistic models, optimization, and machine learning are explored and utilized.
