My research consists of three parts: behavior prediction, motion planning and decision making. 

My research goal is to develop reliable prediction algorithms that can be used on the autonomous vehicle.  Although motion planning and decision making are lower modules of prediction, it is important to consider the integration and relationships among these modules while formulating the prediction problem. Only in this way, can we make sure that the predicted results are useful and can make positive effects on the lower modules of the ADAS system. 



## Behavior Prediction





## Motion Planning





## Decision Making
